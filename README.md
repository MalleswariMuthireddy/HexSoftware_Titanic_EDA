# Titanic EDA Project

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to identify key insights about passenger survival.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ”Ž Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning (handled missing values in Age, Embarked, dropped Cabin).
2. Feature Engineering (FamilySize, Title extraction).
3. Exploratory Analysis (Survival by Gender, Class, Age, Fare).
4. Visualization using Seaborn & Matplotlib.

## âœ… Key Insights
- Females had higher survival rate than males.
- 1st class passengers survived more compared to 3rd class.
- Younger passengers had better survival chances.
- Higher fare correlated with higher survival.
